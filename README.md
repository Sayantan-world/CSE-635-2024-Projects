# CSE-635 Semester Long Project

### Overview
The goal of this semester-long project is to provide hands-on experience designing, implementing, evaluating, and demonstrating a complete web mining/ text mining/ social media mining solution based on a combination of natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML) techniques. You are provided a choice of four topics that broadly fall into the AI for Social Impact area. Each project (except one) will have a standard dataset and ground truth, enabling quantitative evaluation. Many of these are from past or ongoing challenges and have been attempted by other teams. We encourage you to use any available online tools or platforms to develop your solution. You should strive to produce results in the top 10% of any previously published results on the same dataset. While there is a quantitative evaluation component in the last stage, you must develop a live demo system. This may involve developing a user interface so you can demonstrate the system.

This project will satisfy the MS project requirements specified by the CSE department. While the problem definition and evaluation dataset have been fixed, there is ample room for creativity on your part in further enhancement of the solution and implementation. Be creative, and most importantly, pace yourself properly during the semester. Your project is divided into three phases, which are described in more detail later on in this document:

- Phase 1: Submission of project proposal and in-person presentation of your proposal. This includes a comprehensive literature review on your selected topic, a necessary step before you begin designing your system!
- Phase 2: Interim report describing the evaluation of the baseline system. 
- Phase 3: Final submission of technical paper, code, and in-class presentation of your end-to-end system.

**Note**: Check the shared document in Piazza for deadlines and grading schemes.

The project choices are as follows:
- P1: LLMs in the Health Sciences
- P2: LLMs in the Social Sciences
- P3: LLMs in the Arts
- P4: LLMs for Societal Good
